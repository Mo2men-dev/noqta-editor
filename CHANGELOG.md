## [1.0.0](https://github.com/Mo2men-dev/noqta-editor/compare/v0.10.0...v1.0.0) - (11-8-2025)

### Breaking Changes

- Refactored the Theming system of the editor.

The old theming system was a little too confusing and not very flexible, so we decided to refactor it to make it more intuitive and easier to use. The new theming system is based on much simpler objects that can be easily modified. This should make it easier to create custom themes and modify existing ones.
